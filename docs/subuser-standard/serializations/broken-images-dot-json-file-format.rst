The broken-images.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an ``broken-images.json`` file which holds a registry of docker images which failed to build and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those images which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each broken-images.json file is to be a valid `json <https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf>`_ file containing a json array at the top level.

This array lists json objects which have the following attributes:

 * ``source-repo``: Id of the subuser repository from which the image was installed.

  Ex::

    "source-repo" : "default"

  Or if the repository is annonymous::

    "source-repo" : 1

 * ``source-image``: Name of the progam source from which this image was built.

  Ex::

    "source-image" : "firefox"

 * ``image-source-hash``: SHA-512 hash of the build context of the image source.

  Ex::

    "image-source-hash" : "51bcf28bcd4c01200ab7abd97d22a325e940fbd6"

 * ``build-log``: Log output of the failed build.
